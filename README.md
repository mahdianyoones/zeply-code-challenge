# Zeply Python Code Challenge

Note: If during installation of the requirements, *bitcoinlib* fails due to **an error related to gmp.h**, you simply need to run the following command which installs gmp.h in the right place:

`sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev`

Then you may reinstall the requirements.
